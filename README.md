# Graph Denoiser
"Dirty" graph edges hurt GNN training. This project aims to provide a preprocessing step to "clean" the edges of a graph using several techniques before GNN training. It aims to 1) removing incorrect edges, 2) add missing edges, and 3) update weights of existing edges.

This project began in October 2025, and I am working on adding more functionailty for the 3 areas of interest.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, but tangible results can already be seen after training the GNN on both the original and our cleaned graph!
